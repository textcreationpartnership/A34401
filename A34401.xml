            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There is ſo cloſe a Connexion between the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Peace of the <hi>State;</hi> That the One cannot be diſturbed without the Other: Theſe are his words, <hi>how much, ſayth he, the Peace of the State is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Peace of the Church: and how difficult a thing it is to preſerve Order and Government in Civil, whilſt there is no Order or Government in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, is evident to the world; and this little Part of the World our own Dominions hath had ſo late experience of it, that, we may very well acquieſce in the concluſion without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging our ſelf in diſcourſe upon it; it being a Subject we have had frequent occaſion to contemplate upon, and to lament abroad, as well as at home.</hi>

                  <hi>would the harmony of affection be amongſt us?

And, on the contrary, the aſſerting of the Lavvs, and the Religion Eſtabliſhed, according to the Act of Uniformity, is the moſt probable means to produce a Setled Peace and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence throughout your Kingdom; becauſe the variety of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions in Religion, vvhen openly indulged, doth directly diſtinguiſh Men into Parties, and vvithall gives them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to count their Numbers; vvhich conſidering the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, that out of a Religious Pride, vvill be kept on foot by the ſeveral Factions, doth tend directly and inevitably to open diſturbance; nor can your Majeſty have any ſecurity that the Doctrine or Worſhip of the ſeveral Factions, vvhich are all governed by a ſeveral Rule, ſhall be conſiſtent vvith the Peace of your Kingdom.</q>

There is one part in it that hath been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to miſconſtruction, which is that concerning the PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISTS; as if more liberty were granted them, than to the other Recuſants; when it is plain there is leſs:</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>THE Title-page having (it ſeems) promiſed you the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſubſtance of the ſeveral Speeches in Parliament, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aforeſaid Heads, incluſively till the end of the laſt,</hi> viz. <hi>in January</hi> 1680/1. <hi>I found my ſelf in Duty bound to add theſe that follow, by way of</hi> Appendix, <hi>to make good the Promiſe; becauſe the Title Sheet was all wrought off before ever I had a view of it: And ſo I hope my Generous Readers will accept of this as a reaſonable Excuſe in my favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS Majeſty being very ſenſible how much <hi>our Diviſions at home</hi> would be likely to <hi>render our Friendſhip leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abroad,</hi> ſaith, <hi>To prevent theſe as much as may be, I think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His Majeſties Speech to his two Houſes,</hi> Monday, <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. 1680. p. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>to you all the Aſſurances which can be deſired, that nothing ſhall be wanting on my part to give you the fulleſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction your hearts can wiſh, for the Security of the Proteſtant Religion, which I am fully reſolved to maintain againſt all the Conſpiracies of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and to concur with you in any new Remedies which ſhall be propoſed, that may conſiſt with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Succeſſion of the Crown in its due and legal courſe of Deſcent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND <hi>in Order to this, I do recommend it to you, to purſue the further Examination of the</hi> PLOT, <hi>with a ſtrict and an Impartial Enquiry. I do not think my ſelf ſafe, nor You neither, till that matter he gone through with: and therefore it will be Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the Lords in the Tower be brought to their ſpeedy Trial, that Iuſtice may be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN his next Speech to his Parliament, the King is pleaſed to remember the ſame thing, and ſaith, <hi>I did promiſe you the fulleſt ſatisfaction your hearts could wiſh, for the Security of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Kings Speech,</hi> Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day December 15. 1680. <hi>pag.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>Proteſtant Religion, and to concur with you in any Remedies which might conſiſt with preſerving the Succeſſion of the Crown in its due and legal courſe of Deſcent: I do again, with the ſame Reſervations, renew the ſame Promiſes to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99779:58"/>
            <p> WELL, His Majeſty, you ſee, having thus given us the greateſt Aſſurances that Words are capable of expreſſing, of his readineſs to do any Reaſonable thing that ſhall be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and offered to him, for the maintaining and defending the Proteſtant Religion to us and our Poſterities; his next work is to tell us wherein he chiefly relies, and thinks himſelf moſt ſafe, great, and happy; and that is, in the Hearts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Good People, and in their joint union among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Take his own words for your ſecurity, in theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>THAT <hi>which I value above all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>King's Speech to both Houſes,</hi> Octob. 21. 1680. <hi>pag.</hi> 6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>the Treaſure in the World, and which I am ſure will give me greater Strength and Reputation both at home and abroad, than any Treaſure can do, is a perfect union amongſt our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTHING <hi>but this can reſtore the Kingdom to that ſtrength and vigour which it ſeems to have loſt, and raiſe us again to that Conſideration which</hi> ENGLAND <hi>hath uſually had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL Europe <hi>have their Eyes upon this Aſſembly, and think their own happineſs or miſery, as well as ours, will depend upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF <hi>we ſhould be ſo unhappy as to fall into ſuch miſunderſtanding amongſt our ſelves, as would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our friendſhip unſafe to truſt to, it will not be to be wondered at, if our Neighbours ſhould begin to take new Reſolutions, and perhaps ſuch as may be fatal to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET <hi>us therefore take care that we do not gratify our Enemies, and diſcourage our friends by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable diſputes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF <hi>any ſuch doe happen, The world will ſee it was no fault of mine; for I have done all that was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to doe, to keep you in peace while I live, and to leave you ſo when I die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT <hi>from ſo great Prudence, and ſo good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as yours, I can fear Nothing of this kind; but doe rely upon you all, that you will uſe your beſt Endeavours to bring this Parliament to a good and happie Concluſion.</hi>
